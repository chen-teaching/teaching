<h1>Academic Integrity Policy: Numerical Analysis (Fall 2023)</h1>
<p>Please see the general <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html">NYU policy</a>.</p>
<p>Any violations of the NYU or course policy on academic integrity may result in punishment. Depending on severity, this could range from receiving a zero on the homework, quiz, or project to failure of the course. Severe violations will be reported to the University.</p>
<h2>Quiz policy</h2>
<p>The quizzes are designed to reinforce specific key concepts from the course.</p>
<ul>
<li>You are allowed one US Letter cheat sheet, blank scratch paper, and writing utensils.</li>
<li>Before the start of the quiz you should fill out your name and netID, as well as the initials of your neighbors</li>
<li>Do not begin the quiz until instructed</li>
<li>Once the quiz begins, you cannot communicate with any other students</li>
<li>All problems will involve only basic arithmetic which does not require a calculator. However, you are allowed a scientific calculator with at most a two line display. Graphing calculators are not allowed. If you are unsure if your calculator is allowed, you should check prior to the quiz.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homework policy</h2>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that you must write up the solutions yourself and you should be able to explain anything you turn in.
Your code should be written <em>entirely</em> by you.</p>
<h3>Collaboration</h3>
<p>You are encouraged to work together with peers. This not only helps to cut down on the workload, but strengthens your own understanding of the topics. This is because explaining concepts forces you to engage with them in a deeper way, thereby building a better understanding of the material.</p>
<p>However, you must still write up your solutions on your own, and you should understand everything you write. For each assignment, you must include who you worked with (first name+last name) or whether you worked alone.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. The friend provides a high level description of their approach.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. The friend sends you their solution and you copy it down. (This is plagiarism)</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. You meet with your friend and they walk you through each step.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You send someone your code. (This is against the spirit of learning)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Internet or other external sources</h3>
<p>Figuring out how to effectively search for information on the internet is an extremely useful skill. At the same time, at some point in your career you will probably come across problems without solutions. Without having developed the proper problem solving skills, it will be much harder to come up with a solution. To balance these two possibilities, you are allowed to use the internet to search for solution to a problem after (i) you have been to office hours or used the discussion board to ask about this problem, and (ii) you have spent at least 24hr on the problem after office hours/receiving a response on the discussion board.</p>
<p>If you use the internet or other external sources, you must cite the source and include a description of how you used the source. Failure to do this is a violation of the course policy and will be penalized.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: It’s always fine (even without going to office hours) to search for generic information (e.g. definition of a word/phrase, coding syntax, etc.).</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You use tools such as Wolfram alpha, Desmos, or ChatGPT to assist with parts of the problem.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You find the answer on the internet and copy it down. (This is plagiarism)</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You have gone to office hours or posted on the discussion board and after a day are still confused. You then find the answer on the internet and understand it. Later, on your own, you reproduce the solution.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You use of Chegg or any other paid services. (This provides an unfair disadvantage to students who cannot afford such services)</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You ask about or post any of the homework questions on forums like stackoverflow. (In the future, your employer will not like you releasing sensitive information in this way.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Large Language Models (e.g. chatGPT)</h3>
<p>The use of LLMs such as chatGPT is a bit of a grey area with respect to many existing norms on academic integrity, particularly plagiarism.
My view is that such tools are only likely to grow in prevalence, so it is important for students to gain experience using them now.
However, it is also my belief that we should all be transparent about where we are getting information.
As such, you must clearly explain how you used such tools on each problem.</p>
<p>Every tool has uses and limitations.
Since LLMs are relatively new, we are still learning about both.
One major limitation of current LLMs is that they do not truly understand anything they are saying.
Rather they generate responses based on text they have been trained on, and are therefore prone to confidently stating incorrect information.
As with all tools, the user must understand when and how to wield them.</p>
<p>The use of LMMs in other classes may treated differently, so you should check with each instructor about their policy.</p>
