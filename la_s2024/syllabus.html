<h1>Syllabus: Linear Algebra I (Spring 2024)</h1>
<h2>Basic Info</h2>
<p>Welcome to Linear Algebra I (GA.2110).
This syllabus contains important information regarding course policies and procedures.
Please also consult the course page on <a href="./integrity.html">Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
<h3>Course goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrate an general understanding of key concepts in linear algebra</li>
<li>Learn to compose simple proofs</li>
<li>Build confidence communicating about advanced mathematical subjects using natural language</li>
</ul>
<h3>Accommodations and Accessibility</h3>
<p>While participation in and engagement with the course is necessary, I recognize that not everyone has the same learning needs. I am happy to work with you directly, or with you in conjunction with the Center for Student Accessibility (CSA) to accommodate your individual needs. This includes accommodations for religious/cultural holidays, learning needs, sickness, etc.

<p><em>Absences which can be forseen must be planned for in advance.</em></p>
<h3>Text</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lax, P.D. (2007). <em>Linear Algebra and Its Applications</em> (2nd ed.)</li>
<li>Axler, S. (2024) <em>Linear Algebra Done Right</em> (4th ed.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading is broken down as the better of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>30% Homework, 40% Quizzes, 30% Final</li>
