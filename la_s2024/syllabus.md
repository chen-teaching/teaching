Welcome to  Linear Algebra I (GA.2110).
This syllabus contains important information regarding course policies and procedures.
Please also consult the course page on [Academic Integrity](./integrity.html).

### Course goals

### Accommodations and Accessibility

While participation in and engagement with the course is necessary, I recognize that not everyone has the same learning needs. I am happy to work with you directly, or with you in conjunction with the Center for Student Accessibility (CSA) to accommodate your individual needs.

## Grading

Grading is broken down as the better of the following:

- 30% Homework, 40% Quizzes, 30% Final
- 30% Homework, 70% Final


### Homework

You are highly encouraged to work with peers on the homework, but you must write up the solutions on your own.

- Homework problems will be a combination of problems from the textbook as well additional problems.
- Homework will be due TBD, unless noted otherwise
- You will always have at least 1 week between the release of a homework assignment and the due date

While subject to change, it is planned that we will have TBD homeworks.

#### Submission policy (Gradescope)

Failure to properly submit homework may result in a grade reduction.

- Typesetting with a program such as LaTeX is required.
- Write the names of anyone you work with on the top of your assignment. If you worked alone, write this.
- Homework should be turned in on Gradescope.
    - Tag your responses on Gradescope. 
- Late homework will not be accepted without prior approval.

### Quizzes

- In general, every other week there will be an in-person quiz at the start of the class lasting about 10-12 minutes.
- The goal of quizzes is to serve as a self-check that you understand the important concepts as we are going.
- The content of the quiz will always focus on the most recent homework.
- While subject to change, it is planned that we will have 6 quizzes.

### Final

- The final exam will be comprehensive.
- The final will either be on the last day of class or the scheduled exam time (TBD).
