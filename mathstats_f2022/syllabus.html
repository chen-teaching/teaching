<h1>Syllabus</h1>
<h2>Basic Info</h2>
<p>Welcome to Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA.0234)!
This syllabus contains important information regarding course policies and procedures.</p>
<h2>Accommodations and Accessibility</h2>
<p>While participation in and engagement with the course is necessary, I recognize that not everyone has the same learning needs. I am happy to work with you directly, or with you in conjunction with the Center for Student Accessibility (CSA) to accommodate your individual needs. This includes accommodations for religious/cultural holidays, learning needs, sickness, etc.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading is broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>15% Participation</li>
<li>35% Homework</li>
<li>25% Quizzes</li>
<li>30% Final Project</li>
</ul>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>Active participation in the course in mandatory, and you are expected to attend all lectures. There are many ways in which you can participate which will earn you participation points. To earn the full 15% participation, you must earn at least 15 points over the course of the semester. Additional points will not translate to a higher score. If you earn 10-14 points you will receive 10%, and if you earn 5-9 points you will receive 5%. Less than 5 points will receive 0%.</p>
<ul>
<li>(10pts, max 10pts) Actively engage in breakout groups throughout semester
<ul>
<li>If you miss one or two classes without prior notice that’s fine. However, substantial absense will disqualify from this category. Please talk to me if you have any questions/concerns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>(5pts, max 5pts) present breakout group’s work</li>
<li>(2pts, max 6pts) Attend office hours</li>
<li>(1pts, max 6pts) Ask/answer a question on the discussion board
<ul>
<li>Questions/answers must be high quality and related to the course materials. Thus, a question like “what is the difference between a definite and indefinite integral?” would get a point, but a question like “is there a quiz today?” would not.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The bar for participation points is relatively low. For instance, if you attend class and participate in breakout groups and present your group’s answers one time, you will earn full credit. Alternately, you could participate in breakout groups and attend office hours 3 times and get full credit.</p>
<p>You are responsible for keeping track of your participation and logging it in the participation assignment on Gradescope. It is recommended to log as you go so you don’t forget when you particpated.</p>
<h3>Homework</h3>
<p>You are highly encouraged to work with peers on the homework, but you must write up the solutions on your own. See the section on <a href="#academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework problems will be a combination of problems from the textbook as well additional problems</li>
<li>Homework will be due Thursdays at the start of class unless noted otherwise</li>
<li>Homework will typically be released on Sunday (11 days in advance). You will always have at least 1 week between the release of a homework assignment and the due date</li>
<li>The lowest homework will be dropped if you fill out the mid-semester and end of semester course evaluations</li>
<li>Write the names of anyone you work with on the top of your assignment</li>
</ul>
<h4>Submission policy (Gradescope)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Homework should be turned in on Gradescope</li>
<li>All problems must be properly tagged and easily readable by the grader</li>
<li>Typesetting with a program such as LaTeX is highly encouraged</li>
<li>Late homework will not be accepted</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quizzes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each Tuesday there will be an in-person quiz lasting about 15 minutes</li>
<li>Quizzes will contain straightforward questions very similar to previous homework problems</li>
<li>The goal of quizzes is to serve as a self-check that you understand the important concepts</li>
<li>The lowest quiz grade will be dropped if you fill out the mid-semester and end of semester course evaluations</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final Project</h3>
<ul>
<li>The last few weeks of the course will be spent on final projects meant to apply he knowledge gained during the course to a real-world problem.</li>
<li>Grading will be based on effort and a project proposal, report, in-class poster presentation, and reviews of your peer’s posters</li>
<li>More details will be given later in the semester</li>
</ul>
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p>The content in lectures will be self-contained but will mostly follow: <em>All of Statistics</em> by Larry Wasserman. A number of homework problems will be taken from this text.</p>
<p>A free PDF download is available to NYU students: <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>For a more in-depth text you can reference: Statistical Inference 2nd edition by Casella and Berger.t</p>
<p>Please see the general NYU policy: https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html</p>
<p>Any violations of the NYU or course policy on academic integrity may result in punishment. Depending on severity, this could include receiving a zero on the homework, quiz, or project, failure of the course, or being reported to the University.</p>
<h3>Homework policy</h3>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that you must write up the solutions yourself and you should be able to explain anything you turn in. This is particularly important because the quiz problems will be very similar to the homework problems.
Working with friends/classmates</p>
<p>As noted in the syllabus, you are encouraged to work together with peers. This not only helps to cut down on the workload, but strengthens your own understanding of the topics. This is because explaining concepts forces you to engage with them in a deeper way, thereby building a better understanding of the material.</p>
<p>However, you must still write up your solutions on your own, and you should understand everything you write. For each assignment, you must include who you worked with (first name+last name). Failure to do this is plagiarism and may be penalized.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. The friend provides a high level description of their approach.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. The friend sends you their solution and you copy it down.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You are stuck on a problem, so you ask a friend how they did it. You meet with your friend and they walk you through each step.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Internet or other external sources</h3>
<p>Figuring out how to effectively search for information on the internet is an extremely useful skill. At the same time, you will eventually come across problems without solutions, and without having developed the proper problem solving skills, it will be much harder to come up with a solution. To balance these two possibilities, you are allowed to use the internet to search for solution to a problem after (i) you have been to office hours or used the discussion board to ask about this problem, and (ii) you have spent at least 24hr on the problem after office hours/receiving a response on the discussion board.</p>
<p>If you use the internet or other external sources, you must cite the source and include a description of how you used the source. Failure to do this is plagiarism and will be penalized.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: It’s always fine (even without going to office hours) to search for generic information (e.g. definition of a word/phrase, coding syntax, etc.).</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: You find the answer on the internet and copy it down.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-ok">okay</span>: You have gone to office hours or posted on the discussion board and after a day are still confused. You then find the answer on the internet and later, on your own, you reproduce the solution.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: the use of Chegg or any other paid services.</li>
<li><span class="syllabus-notok">not okay</span>: asking/posting any of the homework questions on stackoverflow or similar websites</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quiz policy</h3>
<p>Quizzes are to be taken individually without aid. You are not permitted to discuss the content of the quiz with anyone who has not yet taken the quiz (e.g. because they had previously notified me of an absence). You are encouraged to discuss the quizzes with anyone who has already taken them.</p>
